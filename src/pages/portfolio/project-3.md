A back-end application simulating communication between a driver in distress and different entities of roadside assistance, such as police reports and towing. The app utilizes several elements of Amazon Web Services including, SNS, SQS, API Gateway, Lambda functions and DynamoDB.

Ooopsie helps drivers with situations that need to be solved by the services that we provide and streamlines the dispatch of road side assistance to drivers in need.
